# Misterio

A cipher solving game, where you are given a cipher machine with an unknown random configuration and you have to guess its configuration by trying different settings on your own machine and analyzing how your text is ciphered.

# Work in progress

At the current state the game is technically playable. You have both your machine where you can change the configuration and the machine whose configuration you have to guess. You can enter text on both machines and get ciphertext back, as well as change the configuration on your machine. Once you think you got it right, you can reveal the configuration of the second machine.

This functionality however is far from the final objective, which you can check on the to-do list below.

## TODO
- Add game logic (you can check your answer n number of times, or give up and show the answer)
- Design the UI (the current UI is just plain HTML)
- Add a how to play section, explaining the game and what each part of the machine does
- Add difficulty levels
- Ability to share machines
