# Misterio

A cipher solving game, where you are given a cipher machine with an unknown random configuration and you have to guess its configuration by trying different settings and analyzing how your text is ciphered.

# Work in progress

The cipher machine is already implemented and can be used, albeit with a very simple UI, and right now you can't really do anything other than change settings and see how your text is ciphered.

## TODO
- Add game functionality (a second machine with a hidden random configuration that you have to guess)
- Design the UI (the current UI is just plain HTML)
- Add a how to play section, explaining the game and what each part of the machine does
